# GazeTracking
The web application is built using Flask for the back-end and Bootstrap and jQuery for the front-end. Data is sent in real time via a websocket (Socket.IO), and all control (cursor movement and clicks) is performed by the PyAutoGUI module.

Note: This project was made in collaboration with [Youssef Ait Bigane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youssef-ait-bigane-123b43242/).
